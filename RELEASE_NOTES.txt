- **Stability Fixes**:
  - **Crash Fix**: Resolved critical conflict between Audio I2S driver and FastLED by migrating status LEDs to **Adafruit NeoPixel** library.
  - **Partitioning**: Switched to `huge_app.csv` partition scheme to resolve linker overflow errors and support OTA updates for larger binaries.

- **Web Interface Updates**:
  - **LED Brightness Control**: Added sliders for Day and Night brightness (0-42 scale in UI, mapped to 0-255).
  - **Night Mode Schedule**: Added configurable "Night Start" and "End" hours for automatic dimming.
- **Hardware Config**:
  - **Pin Mapping**: Corrected I2S DOUT pin to GPIO 27 (was 22) to resolve conflict with I2C SCL on Lolin D32 Pro.
- **Project Structure**:
  - Renamed project repository/folder to "Dial-A-Charmer".
  - Updated Python utilities to use relative paths.

## v1.2.0 (2026-01-15)
