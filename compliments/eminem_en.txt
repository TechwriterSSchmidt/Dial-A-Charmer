I am a product of my environment ... and my environment is a war zone
Success is my only option failure is not on my plan
Look me in my eyes ... and tell me you can stop a freight train
I started in the dirt and now ... I own the whole hill
Family is everything ... when the spotlight burns out
You better lose yourself in the music the moment you own it
I am not afraid to take a stand everybody come take my hand
I am a fighter for my daughters life like every day is the last
My scars are the map of a career they tried to bury
Trust nobody ... who was not standing with you in the rain
Work is not what you do it is the legacy you leave behind
Sometimes you have to watch the world burn to find your own heat
I am not a product of my circumstances ... I am a product of my decisions
Money fills your bank account ... but not the void in your soul
Betrayal tastes bitter ... but success is the best revenge
Never underestimate a man with nothing left to lose
Life is a roller coaster and ... I ripped the safety bar off
My biggest enemy stares back at me in the mirror every morning
Hate is just disguised respect from people ... who did not make it
I turned my tears into ink ... and painted the world with it
Work so hard until your idols become your rivals
Loyalty is rarer than a winning lottery ticket
I owe nobody nothing except my family and my pride
The streets raised me ... but the music saved me
Dream big or just go back to sleep
Some people want to see you fall just to know how it feels
I am the nightmare you created for yourself
My kids are the only reason ... I have not lost my mind yet
Honesty is expensive do not expect it from cheap people
Every slap in the face was just fuel for my engine
Success is like a ghost everybody talks about it ... but few see it
I do not need a throne ... I just need a mic and the truth
Touch my family ... and you will meet the devil in person
Strength is moving on ... when you really want to quit
I am not here to make friends ... I am here to make history
Life is not a game but ... I play it to win anyway
My pain is my currency and ... I am filthy rich
Let the dogs bark the caravan moves on to victory
Work without passion is just a slow suicide
I am not afraid of the dark ... I was raised in it
Forgive your enemies ... but never forget their names
My success is the receipt for all those sleepless nights
Family means nobody gets left behind no matter how dirty it gets
I am the black sheep ... that leads the flock
Do not listen to the doubters they usually achieved nothing themselves
Life is a hard teacher first comes the test then the lesson
I beat the devil and now ... I am dancing on his grave
Believe in yourself ... when nobody else does that is true power
My words are bullets ... and my mouth is the weapon
Work in silence ... and let your success make the noise
I have more scars than awards and ... I am proud of it
Whoever laughs at you today will work for you tomorrow
Blood is thicker than water ... but loyalty is thicker than blood
I am not a role model ... I am a warning
Life does not give you chances you have to take them
My family is my fortress in a world full of betrayal
Every day is a new war against my own demons
I saw the abyss ... and jumped in to learn how to fly
Success is sweet ... but the road there was bitter
I am the voice of those ... who have no voice
Do not bend yourself just to fit into their small world
My work is my legacy my name is my law
I walked through the fire ... and came out as a diamond
Hate me or love me both are a compliment to me
Family is the only anchor in this ocean
I touched the bottom ... and then pushed off with force
Real men do not cry they rewrite their story
Never underestimate the rage of a quiet man
I lost everything to find out who ... I really am
My music is my diary ... and the world is reading
Work until your name is written all over the walls
I am the storm ... that breaks the silence
Life owes you nothing so stop whining ... and get to work
My children are my biggest award not the Grammys
I have no competition ... I am my own level
True greatness is shown in how you handle defeat
I am the architect of my own destiny
If you live in a glass house pull the curtains when ... I come
My past is my engine for the future
Success is not luck it is hard work
I am the shadow ... that makes the light visible
Family is the only thing ... that matters when the curtain falls
I embraced the pain until it became my best friend
Do not talk about your plans show them your results
I am proof that you can escape from hell
Leave the past behind ... but take the lessons with you
My family is my blood my heart and my pride
I am not a rapper ... I am a fighter with rhythm
Life is a fight and ... I am the gladiator
Work hard in the shadows to shine in the light
I have no time for bullshit ... I have a mission
My name stands for resistance against everything ... that wants to keep me small
Family is the reason ... I never give up
I am the answer to all the questions you are afraid to ask
Success is what happens ... when preparation meets opportunity
I shook off the dust ... and rose to the sun
True friends do not count your mistakes ... but your victories
I am the nightmare of the competition ... and the dream of the fans
Life is a one way street so do not look back
My children are my light in the darkest night
I reached the peak ... and the view is lonely
Money does not make you a man your character does
I am the code you will never crack
Work like there is no tomorrow ... and live like today is the last
I have the devil in checkmate and ... I am not moving
Family is the bond ... that never breaks no matter how hard you pull
I am the calm ... before the storm and the storm itself
True strength is ... when you can smile despite the pain
I buried my fears ... and went for a walk on them
Success is the revenge on everyone ... who did not believe in you
I am the fire ... that never goes out
Let the haters talk their envy is your fuel
My family is my compass in this crazy world
I am the captain of my own ship
Work until you no longer have to introduce yourself
I transformed pain into power
True loyalty shows in the worst times
I am proof that you can achieve anything ... if you want to
Life is a gift even ... if the packaging is dirty
My children are my pride ... and my legacy
I crossed the abyss and ... I am stronger than ever
Faith moves mountains ... but work moves them further
I am the rhythm of my own life
Success is the sum of sweat tears and blood
I am the wind ... that fills the sails of change
Family is the harbor where ... I can always dock
I conquered pain ... and found freedom
True freedom is ... when you do not care about the opinion of others
I am the spark ... that ignites the fire
Work until your signature is an autograph
I am not afraid of failure only of standing still
My family is my everything ... and my nothing without them
I am the champion of my own story
Life is a journey to yourself
I turned the dust of the road into gold
True greatness begins in the mind
I am the warrior ... who never sleeps
Success is the reward for being true to yourself
I am the shadow ... that shows you the way
Family is the only thing ... that really remains
I made the pain dance
Work hard and stay humble
I am proof of the power of words
Life is an adventure for the brave
My children are my pride and joy
I laughed at the devil
True love is the love for the family
I am the beat of my destiny
Success is a journey not a destination
I am the rock in the surf
Family is the reason for everything
I turned pain into gold
Work until the world knows your name
I am the fighter ... who never gives up
Life is what you make of it
My children are my life
I defeated the abyss
True strength comes from within
